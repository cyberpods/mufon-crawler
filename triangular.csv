encounter started for us. we visited for awhile and then our friend went to bed. at that time it was really late, way after 2am. we were both into astronomy and so we decided to sit on the ground next to the apartment(west side of building) and stargaze. we were looking at the stars and admiring the beauty of it all. and it's important to note that from our vantage point we were looking in the eastern sky. after about two hours we were looking up i noticed a white star that seemed a little unusual. it was bigger than all the rest of the stars and there was something about it that didn't seem right and it got my attention. i told my friend to look at the unusual star and so we both starred at it. the star was up about 40 to 45 degrees from the horizon. we were starring and watching this unusual white star for at least 30 minutes. as we were watching this unusually bright star, the rays of the star began to get bigger and bigger. which we both looked at each other in amazement and astonishment. the rays of what appeared to be a bright white star began to almost come directly at us or it appeared that way. as this was going on the wind began to pick up and we heard some rustling in the tall dead grass next to us. we both got a little frightened after that since the rays of the star was unusual enough. we both proceeded to get up from sitting on the ground and try and see if our friend that lived in the apartment was still awake or not. we were going to tell him about the unusually bright star. we couldn't get anyone to answer the door that early in the morning. we then proceeded to go knock on another person's door that he knew that was directly across from the other apartment we were just at. at this point a few hours had passed. as he was opening up the metal screen door to his other friends apartment i was behind him. something caught my attention and we then both turned around looking up and witnessed a large object coming out of the sky. we both were in amazement. we walked out away from the apartment and slightly towards whatever was coming out of the sky. then all i can remember is that there was this blackish grey triangular craft gliding over the top of us. time seemed to slow down at this point. as it was going over us i got a good look at it. it had one small red light directly in the middle of the craft. it had three slightly larger white lights on each corner of the craft. i also noticed that there was multicolored lights moving in between the white lights. like in a pulsating pattern. i remember as the craft was floating over us we both were saying, ""wow"" in total amazement and astonishment. i remember feeling that there was this low humming vibration going through my body and concentrating in my chest.(later on my friend confirms this as well)there was a really low sound but this may have been this low humming sound/vibration. as it floated over us i remember watching it float/glide away from us and again it seemed like an eternity as we both watched it float away. i remember feeling sad that it was going away. we then watched it float up and over these nearby houses. it was moving very slow. in my mind i was thinking that it almost looked unreal at how it was floating and moving up and over the houses. we then frantically went back to his car(chevell) and got in. we just sat there with our jaws open and not saying a word, except for ""did you see that"". as we were pondering in disbelief as to what just occurred we both started to feel as though we were telepathically communicating with each other. this was shocking and scary to us. we almost couldn't look at each other. he then said that he just saw some symbols on my forehead. which was really strange to me. and if the ufo encounter wasn't strange enough. we sat there in his car for a long time trying to take all of the experience in. we were both still in a state of shock. we both agreed that we wouldn't say anything to each other about what we just experienced and that we both would draw on a piece of paper what we saw when he dropped me off at my house. at this point i remember as we were sitting in his car that a trash truck was coming up to the apartments and began to take the trash. we both thought this was unusual and we were thinking why a trash truck would be working this early in the morning. so at this point the time had to have been in the early hours before the sun was to come up. he then proceeded to take me to my house and drop me off. there wasn't alot of talking between us as we were still trying to process what had happened to us. when we pulled up in the front of my house we both agreed to draw what we had witnessed. he got out a piece of small paper which i think it was a receipt and he ripped it in half. he gave me a pencil and we both began to draw what we had seen. we then looked at each other's drawing and it was an exact match. a triangle craft with one light in the middle and three on each corner. we just sat there in disbelief. we said our good byes and i went into my house to go to bed since it was getting light out. so that's the main part of the ufo encounter me and my friend had. now on to the rest... the next afternoon we contacted each other on the phone and as we were discussing the incident some very unusual memories began to emerge. for one we both remember seeing the highway and a bunch of red tail lights going north on the highway. there was a bunch of emergency vehicles going north on 55hwy. and the memory is up in the air somehow looking down and north towards the highway. also the tail lights seemed blurred or elongated. but was definitely a birds eye view of the highway going north. the strange thing is is that from where we were at at the time of the encounter there's no way physically possible to see the highway. this is very strange to me. another strange thing is that about a week later i was working as a janitor at a school mopping the floors when all of a sudden this thought of a blueprint of some sort came into my mind. i don't remember what it was or meant but i talked to my friend at the time about it and he said the same thing happened to him. so that's a mystery as to whether it was related to our encounter. and we weren't sure whether we was abducted but we may have been. that would account for seeing the tail lights go down the highway. one final note i want to add is that my friend said that after he dropped me off he went into the 711 right up the road from the apartments and there was emergency personnel in the gas station talking about something. i'm assuming they got word of the incident from it being reported or saw the craft as well. i'm also willing to take a polygraph test if necessary.","38.4029258","-90.38873129999999","US-03162018-0007"

""my lights"", however, were hardly more than pinpricks in the inky black sky.  they appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude also not unlike satellites.  believing it was a satellite or a trio of satellites, i was not particularly affected by what i saw.  i refer to a ""trio of satellites"" as there was no obvious evidence of the lights being separate crafts or all part of one vehicle. when the lights were almost directly above me, the display upped its ante.  without altering formation, all three lights came to an abrupt halt.  there was no period of slowing down; the forward progress of the -- whatever they were -- stopped on the proverbial dime.  the lights remained stationary for a short time, probably less than five seconds.  then at a much higher rate of speed than they were travelling previously, perhaps as much as ten times faster, the lights moved and disappeared from view.  again there was no period of acceleration:  0 to 100, as it were, in less than a second.  however, they did not travel together in a triangle as they had done when i first saw them.  two of the lights raced off side by side in the same southerly direction.  the third went alone in an easterly direction.  all three were gone from my sight in an unbelievably brief time frame. it was only when the lights hovered and then raced away so quickly that i started thinking i was seeing ufos.  at no time, then or since, have i felt threatened or targeted.  this lack of fear was probably because of what i perceived to be such a great distance between them and me.  i did not suffer any trauma, illness, or disadvantageous long-term effects. to the best of my memory, i have always believed that we are not alone in this enormous universe.  following that incident about four decades ago, i am more convinced of this.  after this sighting, i entered my home and prepared for bed, devoid of any unease.  to be sure, i reflected on what i had just witnessed.  then and since.  i do not feel as though my life has been affected adversely by the events of that night so long ago.  nor do i feel that my life would be disturbed if i were to see the same thing tonight.","52.32931456094333","-112.71275550081097","CA-03142018-0008"

which was a very bright full moon that lit up the night, and a very clear sky. for some reason i started huddling down along the side of the creek so as not to be seen by cars that were driving down the back alley towards their garages (and i wasn't comfortable with people seeing me with a tobacco pipe, in the middle of the night of all things; i can imagine police being called out to announce on a loudspeaker, ""put the crack pipe down and put your hands in the air!"") during times cars weren't driving through the alley i took steps back down into the creek bed and simply glanced in one direction into the night sky, and turned around to the other side, and after glancing back to where i was i felt compelled to look back up-over the creek edge and witness a strange looking ""craft"" (what appeared as some traditional aircraft though wasn't for some reason i can't correctly place) simply positioned over the nearby homes, and zip off what seemed to be a slight sound like a very low-key ""rocket thrust"" as it disappeared. my initial reaction to seeing it was a mix of expletives and shocked amazement, along with incredulity that it was what i think i saw. this proceeded an encounter with the train crossing lights two nights later when i had been playing gun's and roses 'night train' on a cd, and just happened to be approaching a train track as the song was starting. just prior to approaching i can only describe what was going through my mind as expecting something strange to happen; the lights start to blink and the train guard arms go down about half way, only to cancel out and retract back within seconds, though just enough to cause the oncoming cars to slow down a little (and i do believe that numerous train crossing lights will malfunction, and consider this could be interpreted as a possible random coincidence; and yes i do suspect they were malfunctioning around this time in this area for some reason.) several months would still pass following those 1-2 day's experience prior, and following quitting my day (side-cash) job to kind of “reset” myself back to normal circadian rhythm, i was already set on a quest during the night on my lunch break to drive around the area and try and make sense in determining what seemed out of place, which i would do for several months (partly to relieve stress by driving for 10-20 minutes and up to an hour,) but also because i was curious about the possibility of some of these apparent planes in the sky “not seeming quite right."" driving to a neighboring city i noticed a craft stood out as hovering over some apartments, well away from any airports in the area and a decent few miles from where i noticed it and drove to, and which i stopped near the apartment’s road to turn the vehicle around to follow it as it starts to drift off back the direction i came from, towards the highways. during this time several dips in the roads and tree trees would block visibility of it, and i would only accelerate to keep up with it, noticing the ""back"" of the craft facing me. this continued on for about 30 more seconds in which the craft may well have assumed i would keep the same pace i was at, only it appeared to ""look back"" by having what would appear to be the front of the craft, completely rotate in mid air. . . basically what appeared as “headlights” rotated towards me, and perhaps whatever was in control of the object in the sky had done so deliberately, or it realized it goofed and it’s cover had been blown, at which point it disappeared. . . note: this seemed completely unusual to me, though if you consider people claiming to ""summoning"" crafts to be recorded in video, some of them appear to mimic hearts or other strange shapes in the sky; and i suspect movies like transformers could be hinting at the reality, that a robot/a.I. from some advanced civilization could be eavesdropping on humanity, appearing to mirror the human consciousness to some extent, and play off humanities perceptions of terrestrial craft? perhaps if an advanced intelligence behind some program like the phenomenon were to let it be known in some ways to people that they might test in determining readiness for interaction; whether they were prepared for such an encounter, it might well take place in ways that could only be believed by the observer. any claim to the contrary would be expected to be met with ridicule, or outright denial (hence keeping people silent on coming forward with such claims, at fear of social reprisal.) note: these sightings in the sky would continue but in different ways (and no, i didn’t choose to attempt to record anything using recording median, which is why i suppose this will perceived as possible confabulation and possible dubious interpretation resulting from insanity, which i hopefully can assure the reader it is not, and i will explain why i decided not to during the entirety of my experience.) on one occasion i would notice two lights in the sky adjacent to each other and appearing to remain stationary together, and they would simply move away simultaneously. during this time i was of the impression they are here for the reason, that we are basically in a ""cradle"" civilization; basically around the time of these sightings while i was out in the back yard a little light orb (about the size of a large lightning bug) would hover over a tree where a hawks nest had been, and circle it. these crafts were hovering low and right above some houses across from the creek. only recently had that very tree been cut down as it turned out to be dead; though i believe it was a eucalyptus tree, and i had actually not long prior started to experiment with a camera attached to a c-adapter for a telescope, using a meade 8-inch smidt-cassegrain telescope as the lens, which i had bought after the initial sighting. the photos were made of the nest, so it may have stood out in my mind somewhat; and the more i look back, even though i don’t doubt any of my memory nor my sense of observation of it, i do sort of wish i might have done something to record the phenomenon other than the chosen method i resorted to (which is using a ghost radar legacy phone app. . .) which i won't elaborate much on for reasons it probably isn't considered credible. backstory/preface: for whatever reason i stopped trying to document the paranormal; i figured that no matter how much evidence i gathered on any of it, most people were. . . (i'll keep it polite) incapable of comprehending anything that made them question their competency or sanity, of what they believe to be real; part of it's pride of appearing ""grounded,"" by conforming to social norms/conditioning. it doesn't occur to people that they should well forget everything they've ever thought they understood (about religion, about politics, about their peers) and really reflect on that. i had by that time considered myself an atheist or an agnostic, though with strong convictions based off prior recorded class-a evp, that something was similar with the ‘ufo’ phenomenon. i take jacquees vallee’s theory of observation that these things are somehow present in the sky, but also using the human observer as some sort of proxy for observing it. . . that religion and the paranormal perhaps is not unrelated, but that it is tantamount to a psychological praxis which is not altogether conflated with sanity. ***************** this following is an earlier account that i edited down, though also elaborates further in some areas such as what led me to compare the ufo phenomenon to other paranormal. while i did not record the phenomenon visually and relied on something very different, is part because i wanted nothing to prove to anyone and preferred to remain rather independent and decided to it was best i not attempt to share such claims of evidence. when studying the evp phenomenon i noticed that much of it seemed to manifest through atmospheric morphing of sorts (that is, when recording things other than 'class a' evp, it would seem to require taking advantage of ambient electromagnetic wave, which are all around us.) if something existing as a 4th dimensional non-corporeal conscious entity utilizes things within nature that may not seem apparent to our physical senses, i've wondered to what extent the ufo phenomenon exists, and i've come to identify with what jacques vallee describes of it, as something which is a form of non-human consciousness that manipulates space and time, having witnessed something that mimicked terrestrial aircraft and exhibited traits that were seemingly impossible. at the time of this experience i had already witnessed the presence of ufo in the area though i did not attempt much of any photographic evidence despite being relatively experienced with professional grade camera equipment, and studying errors of interpretation and human tendencies to confabulate or deliberately mislead people for attention-seeking behavior such as using cgi, so i didn’t put much stock in it as evidence nor was i convinced it would prove anything to anyone if they weren’t ready for it, and consider myself knowledgeable about perspective and observer phenomenon that misinterprets things such as lacking knowledge of lens phenomenon (such as people interpreting an non-collimated telescope as visual evidence of the stars being conscious intelligent beings; which they are clearly not. . .) i would spend a duration over the next year of trying to make sense of what i experienced, in part because some aspects of that night and the following night persisted in ways that seemed to explain a reality that is little apparent to us, but is nevertheless very real. one thing i left out was that a day or two after the 2014 creek sighting i did experience what i consider may sound like a hallucination such as, ""come closer"" upon waking up, which is the same night while driving to work, while listening to the cd player, the gun's and roses song, 'night train' was playing prior to approaching the train track crossing lights, which started blinking and descended enough to slow traffic towards it, but quickly resumed back to the up position (train crossing lights do glitch out, but this occurrence was uncanny for all the times i've driven over them.) my car's radar detector would also go off later on in the following weeks (and though i had for the longest time noticed an occasional aberrant ku signal, which would go off in sequences of 3, and specifically the ku band frequency (usually reserved for satellites, and non-existent in use within the us for car radar; it was a weird fluke of car radar detectors to have and my detector was a beltronics vector v995). it might have been ""defective"" and eventually i replaced it (though have the old one because of this experience, though what was unusual is how i would simply think of questions and the beeping would start in sequence, and i made an elaborate process of asking questions and elaborated on how sequences would imply a sort of yes or no (though more elaborate than that), and in particular i used an area alongside a highway where i work, which happened to have a toll station that was being dismantled, and i suspect it had an errant transmitter being used to keep track of toll payments, or at least something seemed to cause disruption to my radar detector; and this would make sense to some extent because it mostly only ever happened when at that location, however it would occasionally persist as a ku burst of 3. eventually i started to use a program called ghost radar legend (which is different from the classic version in that it enabled recording of what was spoken and sent via email to myself,) and some unusual things occurred with that such as the program turning off and on its own, and it would very clearly interact with what i was doing (and i would leave the program running with the phone turned off, and for whatever reason it was able to do things that should not have been remotely possible for it.) i am convinced of what jacques vallee has talked about, and i'm pretty sure at some point in time, humanity has become aware of its presence in various ways. at the time i had started meditating intently and experienced something that was very strange, and though i have in large part left these experiences behind and hardly looked back over it, it has persisted in ways that have only caused me to question the extent of how our society operates. perhaps it only makes sense for those that have attempted to make sense of it on a certain level, and that for most people (the vast majority) they would find it much easier (perhaps ""comforting"") to ignore that it must be real. in fact much of my exploration of things like evp and driving out into the middle of the night was to convince myself that none of it could be true; only to convince myself otherwise. i’m fully convinced that these kinds of phenomenon have been ongoing and likely have deep roots in humanities past. some reading this might have come to some conclusion, that i could not fully elaborate on all of the experience;

(i'm 29 now, so we're talking around '96-'97), so i can't give a specific date or time and of course my testimony is not reliable. i witnessed this with my sister who is 6 years older than me, although when i've asked her about it recently, she told she's seen so many ufo's in her life they all kind of blend together, and while confirming the event seemed hazy on the details i offered her.as best as i can remember it was after dinner and i was playing with my sister in the front yard. i distinctly remember calling my sister over to show her a spider i found in a shrub that was hurriedly spinning up a captured bug in it's web. this was in san jose, california where the winters are pretty mild, but i feel like seeing the spider outside probably means it wasn't winter. i was kind of transfixed for a bit watching the spider work, and it had gotten dark. that was when we hear a loud noise from the sky. in my child's memory it sounded like a giant laser, like a sonic boom, but... higher pitched? the sound was accompanied by an object that seems to fly across the entire sky in only a second. it was a triangle rapidly spinning. i couldn't tell if it was a flat triangle or a triangular prism, as it seemed to be spinning on multiple axes, like a gyroscope. but the most distinctive thing was the light it created, it was bright red- or it could have been more orangish, or pinkish, but for the brief moment this thing was careening across the sky, it seemed to light up the whole world in a red hue which lasted for split-second after the object had flown out of sight, then faded away. i have no idea how high up it was but it seemed to me to be around the same height as airplanes fly. i remember going inside and being surprised our parents didn't hear it, because it was loud! i remember not registering what we saw as a ""ufo, like on the x files"" until my sister told me that's what it was, and then being terrified. i remember us describing it to our parents and them suggesting that because we described it as coming from the west or north-west that it might have come from moffett field air base, just to the northwest of us in the blossom hill neighborhood of south san jose. i remember asking classmates about it the next day and getting blank stares. it's always bothered me that what i saw was so loud and so bright and over such a densely populated area that it seems impossible that this could have been an experience limited to only me and my sister. whatever this was, it's not something you would miss if you didn't happen to be looking up at the sky at the right moment. it was the kind of thing you'd think would be more likely to draw neighbors out of their homes saying ""what the hell was that?""

it appeared to blend in with the sky, with the lightest translucent color that you could see. it was moving so fast that, again, unless you were looking, just a little off, you would have missed it or passed it off as a flash. i was fortunate enough to see it from my building and followed it with my eyes, until it went so far that i couldn't see it anymore. the size must have been pretty big, because it was much much longer than any plane in the sky or width of a nearby building, across from me. the night was super clear, so i'm not experienced at determining height in the sky. it did look to be 10-20 degrees above a tree line, but could have been quite high....Due to my inexperienced eye. what struck me so odd was the perfect shape of this translucent light.....It had a begunning and end. also, the pathway that it was on was absolutely straight, fast and looked to be intentional.... versus a falling star that's a little imperfect. after my initial awe, i had the thought that whatever this was, blended in the night sky so we'll, that it was meant not to be seen, or was "" blending in"". it was moving so fast, on it's straight path, that it would certainly have been missed if you just glanced up. i was, unfortunate enough, to have caught site of a moving object in my site, and was able to follow it until it disappeared. i have seen many odd things in the skies above this area, but this was just plain bizarre. i did watch it until it disappeared and waited for 10-15 minutes to see if i could see another anomaly, or see if there would be anything in the area that could possibly explain this light anomaly. i saw nothing else unusual, that evening and ran immediately to tell my elderly mother what i had just seen"" this time"". i have two other very odd sightings that i have not reported, because i thought there were so many things seen in my area, that i may not be taken seriously. i avoid my back porch, for this reason. it makes you feel a little scared, after so many odd occurrences. quickly, i will add two more. one evening, about three months ago, i was watching a normal airplane go across the sky...From north to south east, when the plane all of a sudden had a second identical plane, just behind and below it. i actually stood in amazement thinking i was seeing a rare phenomenon of the light bouncing off of the clouds and causing a mirror effect. i thought it was really cool looking! we had low cloud cover, that evening and the plane was below the clouds. i thought i was seeing a rare mirror effect of the planes lights on the mist in the air. i watched it until it disappears around the end of my building. i had watched this plane across the sky and this happened only near the end of the sighting. i ended the evening thinking i had seen something cool, until i told my ex what i had seen and he pointed out that if it was a mirror effect, that it would have been an opposite image of the plane and not an exact image. he also pointed out that it wouldn't have been behind the plane, but under or over it! i hadn't thought about that, but scientifically, it was true. i still don't know what i saw. one last quickie. i was changing my puppies, doggie pads, on my back porch.....That's why i'm out there in the first place....Most of the time, because i try to avoid going out there.....When a very large triangular set of extremely bright red lights came directly down the center of the field where my back patio faces! it was 5 bright red lights, in a triangle pattern....One light leading the object. it slowly and soundlessly went west to east, not way up in t nohe sky. it made no sound, it was constant speed and kept going slowly until i could see only the back red lights of the object, at a distance. i ran and got my elderly mother, who also saw the tale end of it. the lights were huge and you could see them from a good distance because they were so bright. this was about six months ago. i don't know what's going on, in my area, but i'm not a nut case! these things are really happening and i'm not sure if our government is doing something in this area, that we don't know about, or is there something more to be afraid of. for now, i will change my dogs pee pee pads, on the back balcony, with my eyes shut! i would love to know if others are seeing unexplained occurrences in the skies above the chesterfield/ richmond virginia area.I can mail sketches, if it would be helpful.","37.52513782658703","-77.62120689464405","US-02232018-0012"

no idea! in between all of this another tr3b flew very low almost right over me and my neighbor. i yelled for him to look and basically said see i told you! he thought i was either nuts or on something when i told him about the night before. he seemed spooked and nervously said i'm sure it was just a plane.. i asked how many planes that low make zero noise?! what i can't understand about all of this is there was no mention of anything in the local paper,  news outlets small and large.  any online searches came up dead.  i asked so many people locally if the spotted anything and pretty much all look at me like i have 3 heads.  only 1 neighbor up the block knew what i was talking about. he seemed ecstatic when he walked by and i asked him about it. he stated his mother kept bugging him about the crazy stuff in the sky. that's basically me, my girlfriend and some guy and his mom that seen this.  i find it all so strange.  mainly due to the sighting being so large both in number of craft and duration of the event. are you or anyone else aware of any of this? if so i would love to hear! keep in mind that before all of this i have never seen a single ufo or et in my entire existence spanning 38 years.. i guess what else bothers me is the ""coincidence"" i see surrounding this. as i stated earlier i have always had a deep interest in all of this. what excites me and almost scares me though is the week leading to this i had my always deep interest turn into an obsession that's dominated every thought to the point of extremes i cannot describe. it was as though i experienced having premonitions about it all and as if someone or something was calling out to me...I know it sounds crazy. believe me i have no doubt i'm  the resident crazy on my social media circle. it ain't over yet either...Its been a bit strange since.. guess i'll just have to see how far the rabbit hole goes. sorry for all my rambling and if you read this then thank you for taking the time...Sorry no pics. i'll try again over next few nights","40.22570344479326","-76.81586285929738","US-10302017-0012"

his very descriptive discussion was deleted eventually by mufon, for what reason i'm not aware of. he was very adament  that it was a triangular soundless flying craft. his discussion report would be excellent info for investigators. 5:55  - 6:00 pm a private aircraft came into view flying toward the front of the ufo formation, flying perhaps slightly lower. we live  a  mile from the main runway of queen city airport where this aircraft probably had just taken off from. his altitude was around 800 feet. that would put the ufo's around an altitude of 1000 - 1400 ft.  our attention  was diverted away from the aircraft by a round white light that came on inside and near the bottom of each ufo. these were similar to a landing light on an aircraft and slowly went on and off /on. no pattern. no beam was hitting the ground that we could see.the ufo's remained stationary. we drove on lehigh st. to emmaus.  one of the 3 white lights (triangular craft) was not far from us (400 ft. or less). blocked from getting closer by a moving norfolk southern freight train. very good look at the light which was bright amber almost like large flames flickering and moving upright or vertical but seemed contained in an invisible  enclosure like an old tear shaped christmas tree ball. very, very impressive and pretty. months passed.  i came across a u-tube one hour movie titled ""the phoenix lights-the documentary. a skeptics discovery ""that we are not alone"":  based on book by lynne d. kitier, md. she witnessed the phoenix lights. just after 17 minutes into the film there was a beautiful computer graphic rendition of those lights which were exactly like the lights we saw except our lights were dull red.                                     i am retired. was employed in field of engineering most of my life where observation was an important leg of my work. i completed  5 years of college. my last 10 years of employment was with the penna. dept. of transportation working as a field engineering tech. in their traffic safety dept. where observing was a very critical aspect of my position.  i'm a military veteran and for 13 months in korea i pulled night guard duty directly behind the rear of the dmz between north and south korea.  observing once again was paramount to my work. i have been an aviation enthusiast since 1st grade in elementary school and also built many (beyond comprehension) model aircraft thru the years and attended many air shows. at 5:45pm  on the sighting day the perfect formation coming out of the south is what initially caught our attention plus our parked car was facing that direction.I did not want to leave my wife alone while i looked for my camera in our house. plus this was too intriguing to leave. we actually watched in awe knowing these were ufos. after a life time of engineering discipline i am now more receptive to the unknown.    i always thought it would be cool to see a ufo and since we saw this 20 minute show it's far better than that.

(picture attached). it was also very thick, and appeared to be much lower in the sky than a normal contrail left by a plane. we started examining the clouds more. maybe we were seeing things that werent there. maybe not. i got the distinct vibe that something was happening though. i noticed more lines in the sky, almost like gridwork... many trails in the sky leading towards a point farther south/south east.(pictures attached) we observed that some of the cloud formations were strange.(pictures attached) very wispy, almost too wispy. i had the instinctive feeling that i should pull out my phone and take some photos and videos. so i did. as i was looking around, maybe about 8 minutes into the drive, i saw something. at least, i think. again it could be my mind showing me what i want to see. but i was looking south east ish, but up towards the sun. i saw a disk shape with a dome on top and below. but it was just an outline, and the shape itself looked as though it were made of clouds and sunlight. i only saw the faintest outline of the edges, almost like the bright sun was cutting through a cloaking device, making the outline of the craft visible? i saw for only a short instant and then it was gone. it was a surreal feeling in that instant, and in that moment i knew i was seeing something, but after it was gone i started to question myself. did i really see that?as we arrived at our destination at our friends house, i began to look through my videos and take some screenshots. something inside me was saying, ""put thise images under a filter! solarize the images and see if you see anything!"" i don't know why but i knew i had to do that. what i found was strange. some of my images of the clouds, when out under a solarization filter, show nothing but blank sky. and other images, show strange heat sources and patterns in the sky and clouds. i have included these photos as well. there is what appears to be some vaguely disc shaped heat sources, and some possibly triangular shapes. some heat sources are massive and some are just small flecks. one photo i took showed no heat sources under the solarization filter, but there are 2 distinctly saucer shaped things in between the clouds, partially concealed by the cloud. we went into our friends house to hang out and after about an hour we left. when we left there were still some odd lines in the sky but the cloud cover had become very....""normal"" looking. no patches of blue sky, just a completely flat overcast. my partner and i left and headed over 89 back towards mt shasta city. on the way, i saw what is called a sundog. a patch of rainbow in the sky. i've seen sundog once or twice before, but this one seemed different. it was more blurry at the edges but the longer i stared at it the more certain i was that it was a perfect sphere. when we arrived in mt shasta city to get gas, i could no longer see it.  i am only able to upload 10 files with this report. however i have much more photos and videos i am unable to submit and would like to be able to so that a team could really analyze it all.","41.2497685","-122.135266342664","US-10112017-0012"
